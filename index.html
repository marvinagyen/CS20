<p> Hi! My name is Marvin Agyen. I'm a junior at Tufts majoring in Human
Factors in the school of Engineering. I'm originally from the Bronx, NY. <br>
Something you can't tell about me from first glance is that I wear size 14 shoes.
Also, here are images of Bryant Park, my favorite place in NYC: </p>
